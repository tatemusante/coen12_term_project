createDataSet  O(m)
destroyDataSet O(1)
searchID       O(logn)
insert         O(n)
del            O(n)

For application 2 I decided to use a sorted array because this would optimize the Big-O run time for the most frequent operation (searchID).
I sorted the array by ID so that I could search by id with O(logn) run time.
An unsorted array would have a searchID efficiency of O(n).
